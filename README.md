# Overview

Welcome to my GitHub. I am currently enrolled at Drury University and I will be adding projects from my computer science classes. Most of my computer science projects already have repositories on GitHub, but are private to prevent academic dishonesty between past and present students. The repositories I will be adding will have README files attached describing what code I have personally done and what was done by my professors. To prevent academic dishonesty, I will be informing my professors of which projects I will be adding to my public GitHub.
